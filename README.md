## How to use
To use this framework, simply clone this repository and add a web driver to the resources folder, then 
start writing either unit tests or feature tests in cucumber.

## Areas of potential extension
The easiest and best way to extend this framework is to just add more simple cucumber statements. If you want to
add more way to get data, go for it!

## Project Management
We completed this project in a scrum team, with Alexander (The owner of this repository) as our scrum master.
To manage our tasks we used a kanban board, accessible via the "projects" tab of GitHub. There we would keep track 
of our user stories and who was working on them, along with what we had left in the backlog.

We also created a UML diagram of how we would like the foundation of the program to be made, so that when we were
working on parts that others were dependent on they could simply look at the UML diagram and plan ahead so that
there was no loss in efficiency.

## What did we learn from this?
One of the major things we learned from this is the differences between Web testing and API testing, with web testing's
difficulty coming from HTML code formatting and finding specific elements in the page to test, and API testing's
difficulty coming from the volume of data that some APIs provide.
